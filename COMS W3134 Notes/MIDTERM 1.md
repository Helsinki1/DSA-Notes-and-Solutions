**Takeaways & Reflections**
* you MUST declare each method in an interface if you extend it onto a class
* only ONE public class can be declared in one java file
* you don't have to compile java files in any specific order, the dependencies can be understood naturally by the compiler
* you don't need the "public" keyword for declaring interfaces
* when you add to a circular queue, it's inserted at the end & the end is pushed back
* when you remove from a circular queue, it's removed at the front & front is pushed
* FOR LINKED LISTS & TREES, if you set a local variable equal to the root, then traverse the data structure through the local variable, you are still making permanent changes to the data structure because those local variables ARE POINTERS (they don't actually make a copy of nodes on the data structure, but rather point to the nodes on the actual tree/data structure)
