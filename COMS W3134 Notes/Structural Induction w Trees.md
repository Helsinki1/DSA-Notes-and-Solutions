Induction Steps
1. Prove a condition holds true for a simple base case
2. Hypothesize that this condition holds true for parameter = base case to parameter = some k
3. Show that the condition is also true when parameter = k+1
Proof by Contradiction
1. Suppose that a theorem is false
2. Then show a counterexample that shows the valid scenarios were more than originally proposed

Facts about Binary Search Trees
* A perfect binary tree of length "h" has 2^k+1 - 1 nodes
* A binary tree with "n" nodes has a height of at least log_2(n+1)-1
* A full binary tree of "n" nodes has (n+1)/2 leaves
