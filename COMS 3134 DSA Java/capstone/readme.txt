BST: 2.7468 seconds
RBT: 1.8626 seconds
Hash: 1.5286 seconds

===================================== Q2 =======================================

I expected MyHashMap to have the best performance because its lookup time complexity is only Theta(1), and I expected BinarySearchTrees to be the slowest as its lookup time complexity is O(N) (worst case scenario). These predictions do correlate with the actual runtimes of processing WarAndPeace using each data structure. The "map.get()" method took considerably longer for RBT and BST than the HashMap.
